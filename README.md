# eos-osc-mock

it's a simple osc server that mimics parts the etc eos osc api. this repo is maintained by [sndwrks](https://sndwrks.xyz/haze-watch). shameless self plug, checkout our haze watch product currently in PoC at the Public.

it has a companion qlab file and the show control manual that is implemented in the code.

# edit in your favorite text editor
nano .env
```

## implemented messages

the etc eos osc command library is pretty large, so not everything has been implemented or tested. i do not own an eos console (hence why i made the mock), so if you fire it up and find messages are not up to spec please open an issue. if you find that messages are accurate to the eos implementation open up an issue or pr to let me know it's correct and i'll update the table.
